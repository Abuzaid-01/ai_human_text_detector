**🧠 AI vs Human Text Classifier ✍️******
This project is a Streamlit web app that classifies whether a given piece of text was written by a human or generated by an AI language model, using a pretrained RoBERTa model.

🔍 Overview
Using the Hugging Face Transformers library, a RoBERTa-based model is used to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. The app provides a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

The model is loaded either from a local directory or directly from the Hugging Face Model Hub.
