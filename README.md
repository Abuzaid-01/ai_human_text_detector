🧠 AI vs Human Text Classifier ✍️
This project is a Streamlit web app that classifies whether a given piece of text was written by a human or generated by an AI language model, using a pretrained RoBERTa model.

🔍 Overview
Using the Hugging Face Transformers library, a RoBERTa model trained elsewhere is loaded from a local directory and used to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. The app provides a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

🚀 Features
Paste any text into the app.

Instantly classify whether it's Human- or AI-written.

Displays confidence score for the prediction.

Clean, interactive UI built with Streamlit.
